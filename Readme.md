# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository contains various sorting algorithms implemented in Python. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script for easy understanding and testing.

## Algorithms Included

1. [x] **Bubble Sort:** `bubble_sort.py`
   - Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. [x] **Selection Sort:** `selection_sort.py`
   - In-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region.

3. [ ] **Insertion Sort:** `insertion_sort.py`
   - Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, iteratively taking elements from the input data and inserting them into the correct position.

4. [ ] **Merge Sort:** `merge_sort.py`
   - Divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input into smaller parts, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

5. [ ] **Quick Sort:** `quick_sort.py`
   - Divide and conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## Usage

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a standalone Python script. You can run them individually to see how they work. For example:

```bash
python selection_sort.py
